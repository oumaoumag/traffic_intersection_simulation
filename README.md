# traffic_intersection_simulation
This project simulates a dynamic two-way traffic intersection with autonomous vehicles and independently controlled lights. Users can spawn vehicles at entry points, each following traffic rules. Built in Rust, the simulation aims to visualize flow, manage congestion, and prevent collisions interactively.
